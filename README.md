Ny name is Marek, and I am a passionate Frontend Developer with expertise in React. As a self-taught developer, I am continuously learning and improving my skills in web development. I have a solid foundation in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and I have honed my skills in React by building several projects, which you can find on my GitHub profile.

🔥 Here are some of my recent projects:

- 🚀 [Project 2](https://github.com/Marek-A/project2): A simple e-commerce website using React and Stripe API.
- 🎨 [Project 3](https://github.com/Marek-A/project3): A color palette generator using React and Material UI.

👨‍💻 I am always looking for opportunities to collaborate with others in the tech community, so feel free to reach out to me!
